            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img id="my-image" src="images/jerome-photo.png" alt="Jerome Hunter Image">
            <p>I'm a born-and-bred Jamaican dreamweaver, riding the waves of creativity in the dazzling world of advertising. With over 15 sun-soaked years in the game, I've been the captain of a ship called "Innovation," steering through uncharted waters and making ripples that reach straight to the hearts of those I'm trying to reach. My secret sauce? A pinch of intuition, a dash of inspiration, and a whole lot of understanding the rhythm of advertising, so my ideas stick like that irresistible reggae beat.</p>
            <p>I've got this knack for conjuring up ideas that feel like a cool breeze on a hot day, they just hit the spot. It's like I've got a special antenna tuned into the frequency of what people want, and I'm always cooking up fresh concepts that leave an impression as lasting as a sunset. From catchy jingles that get stuck in your head like a favorite tune, to visuals that make your eyes do a happy dance, I'm all about crafting stories that light up faces and spark conversations.</p>
            <p>Other things about me: I was born on the 6<sup>th</sup> month and on the 8<sup>th</sup> day. <em>Don't forget my birthday!<br></em> I'm also glad to be apart of <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>.</p>
